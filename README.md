# AESHA3-Encryption
This repository contains the implementation of customised Advanced Encryption Standard-based (AES) based encryption algorithm, AESHA3.

In this implementation, I have implemented a custom and more efficient encryption algorithm for IoT devices, AESHA3, based on AES. 
The key schedule or the sub key generation process of AESHA3 uses the Secure Hash Algorithm - 3 (SHA-3) algorithm to generate the subkeys. It is $\sim$ 1300 times more efficient than the traditional AES. 

For more details on this approach and the results, you can refer to my paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10831459 (In case you don't have access to IEEE, please feel free to reach out to me via email or create a PR for the same, I will send it to you)
